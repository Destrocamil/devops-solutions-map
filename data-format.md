# Data file format

DevOps Solutions Map uses a data file name by default `solutions.yaml` and expected to be in the `data/` folder.

This file defines the displayed content. It is split into two main sections.

## devops section

`devops` is the tools list according to their use case and their role in the DevOps delivery chain. The most basic file structure is the following one :

```yaml
devops:
  sides:
    - name: dev
      steps:
        - name: plan
          usecases:
            - name: Use case name
              tools:
                - name: Tool name
                  state: adopt
```

- `sides` is the key related to the two sides of the DevOps : the Dev and Ops columns.
- `steps` is the key for each step in the DevOps workflow : Plan, Code, etc.
- `usescases` is the key for the cards displayed for each column
- `tools` is the key for each tool inside a use case

| ` devops.sides.steps.name` | `string` | Yes | `plan` / `code` / `build` / `test` / `release` / `deploy` / `operate` / `monitor` | The label for the steps. This label is automatically capitalized. |
| ` devops.sides.name` | `string` | Yes | `dev` | The label for the Dev section. This label is automatically capitalized. |

| ` devops.sides.usecases.tools.isnew` | `boolean` | No| `False` | If `True`, the "New" icon will be displayed on the tool's card. |

### State legends

Four different status are available for each tool, and two special one.

| State | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| Assess | This tool is evaluated for a potential adoption. Not yet trialed but considered for a futur usage. |
| Trial | This tool is considered as promising but not yet widely adopted, the organization is evaluating its value. |
| Adopt | This tool is the current core model solution for this use-case. |
| Hold | This tools is considered as outdated and no longer relevant. It should not be used anymore. |

Special states

| State | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| \<state\> âœ¨ | This tool is a new entry in the radar. |
| \<Grey card\> | This tools is in an unknown status. |

## tools section

The `tools` section is made for describing the Tool : publisher, license, external reference, and custom tags. A relation is made by the application using the tool's name as declared in both the `devops` and `tools` section.

```yaml

tools:
  - name: VSCode
    descr: blah
  - name: Jira
    descr: blah
 
```

For example, if you declare `GitHub` in the `devops` section, but not in the `tools` section, the tool description will be incomplete. However, the tool's page will remain able to display the tool's usages.

| Key | Type | Mandatory | Default | Description |
| ---  | ----- | --------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `tools` | - | Yes | - | The top level of the `tools` section |
| `tools.name` | `string` | Yes | `None` | The tool's name, must match the name declared in the use cases. |
| `tools.descr` | `string` | No | `None` | The tool's description. |
